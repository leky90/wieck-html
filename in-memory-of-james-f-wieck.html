              <p>
                It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of James
                F. Wieck, co-founder and chairman of the company that proudly
                bears his name. Jim passed away on November 21, 2024, at the age
                of 80, following a courageous battle with lymphoma.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jim began his illustrious career in journalism at United Press
                International, where he served as a reporter, editor, bureau
                manager and troubleshooter across the United States. Known for
                his unwavering integrity and natural ability to connect with
                people, Jim’s reputation for honesty quickly became a hallmark
                of his character.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1991 Jim co-founded Wieck with Travis Hughs, then brought in
                Tim Roberts and Marge Boatright to launch the company. Under his
                visionary leadership, Wieck transformed from an analog image
                distribution service into an industry leader in digital media
                libraries and social media consulting.

                Jim’s mentorship made a lasting impact on journalism and
                everyone he worked with. His influence extended far beyond his
                titles. He shaped countless careers, leaving behind a generation
                of professionals who carry forward his values.
              </p>
              <p>
                His wit was matched only by his deep sense of responsibility to
                do things the right way. Jim was like the voice in your head
                reminding you to do the right thing by anyone. He was true to
                his values, a trait that inspired respect and admiration from
                many. In a world of shortcuts, Jim always chose the path of
                integrity, proving time and time again that principles matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond his professional life, Jim was a man of eclectic passions
                and profound relationships. He loved the arts and had an
                impressive collection of fine art, trinkets and treasures, each
                with a story.

                A long-time Formula 1 racing fan, he followed the sport with the
                same enthusiasm that defined his career. He loved venturing to
                Laguna Seca, his all-time favorite track, for a weekend race or
                enjoying the iconic Indy 500 at Indianapolis Speedway.
                Occasionally, you could find him soaking up the raw excitement
                of dirt bike racing at the Devil’s Bowl Speedway in Mesquite.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jim brought energy and humor to every room he entered. He wanted
                to chat with anyone, anywhere. A loyal father, friend, mentor,
                and colleague, he was someone you could count on without
                question.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jim is survived by his ex-wife and mother of his children, Janet
                Edmonsond, their daughters, Andrea Bilyeu, Jennifer Boita,
                Allison Wieck, and his 10 grandchildren.

                A celebration of his extraordinary life will take place in

                  <p>
                    If there was a living embodiment of Abraham Lincoln in the
                    20th century and well into the 21st, it was Jim Wieck. His
                    graciousness, beard, Missour-uh twang, eyes, determination,
                    stubbornness, gentleness and soul were reminiscent of the
                    great 16th president. The only thing missing was the top hat
                    and the 6-foot 4-inch frame, but he would have worn the
                    former well and carried the latter with ease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jim was the exceptional man – gifted not only with the
                    qualities of a gentleman but also with that of a highly
                    talented professional and inspirational leader. I first set
                    eyes on him in March 1985, after transferring from UPI’s
                    Washington bureau. I was the new kid in the bureau – all of
                    22 – and the company’s newest, perhaps youngest, regional
                    sales executive. Like Marge Boatright, John Hollar, and Phil
                    Magers, and many others in Dallas, Jim welcomed me with open
                    arms. As my first weekend in Dallas approached, he mentioned
                    he was throwing a get together on Saturday afternoon and
                    invited me. He seemed genuinely surprised and very much
                    delighted when I arrived. We sat in his back patio and,
                    later, the kitchen, discussing UPI’s trials and tribulations
                    and our lives over more than a few Coronas, sealing what
                    would become our strong working relationship and friendship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jim was always curious to know what the clients and the
                    prospects thought of UPI, especially during its early days
                    in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He was in frequent contact with
                    the clients, too, which made him a terrific news wire
                    executive. Committed to great journalism, he was equally
                    aware the newspapers, radio and television stations paid the
                    bills. He had a fierce sense of fairness, too. As stories
                    about UPI’s senior executives’ spending habits emerged,
                    giving every appearance of being highly inappropriate, Jim
                    didn’t hesitate to call it out to the CEO, Luis Nogales,
                    pointing out that there were many at UPI making profound
                    financial and personal sacrifices by working there. Like
                    many others, American Express was after me for the thousands
                    of dollars I racked up in expenses, which weren’t reimbursed
                    after the company filed for Chapter 11. At one point, when I
                    did pay a portion of the bill, my rent check bounced,
                    causing another set of headaches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On a fateful Friday in August 1985, I started the day in
                    Louisiana, making sales calls before returning to New
                    Orleans for a Southwest Airlines flight to Love Field. I
                    landed around 4 and returned to the bureau to read my mail.
                    Instead of doing so alone in my office, I found an open desk
                    (there were a few) in the newsroom, so I could hear the
                    chatter. I had just started reading the letters, when the
                    slot editor said loudly, “There’s been an explosion at the
                    airport,” which came from the police radio next to him. Jim
                    was staring at his tube, perhaps wondering how we were going
                    to cover this explosion, when walked over to him, saying
                    softly, “Jim, if you need help, I’m here,” figuring he’d put
                    me on the desk to make phone calls and take dictation from
                    the reporters covering the event. Instead, he did something
                    I’ve never seen since: He swung around in his swivel chair,
                    leapt about a foot in the air, bellowing, “Get out there!”
                    while pointing in the direction of DFW. “Yes, sir!” I
                    replied before grabbing a few notebooks and pens, and
                    joining photographer Gerald Schuman, who took me as close as
                    possible to the crash site; I ran the rest of the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was a fantastic team effort, resulting in a great night
                    for UPI’s Dallas bureau. We clocked Rox big time, getting a
                    signer on the front page of the bulldog edition of The New
                    York Times. A Louisiana journalism professor, monitoring
                    AP’s and UPI’s coverage, wrote a report – which he submitted
                    to Editor & Publisher magazine – saying UPI clobbered AP in
                    its coverage of the crash of Delta flight 191.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We stayed in touch after I transferred to Philadelphia,
                    something I wasn’t happy about and neither was he. We talked
                    after hours, and I would often bemoan the attitude of
                    Pennsylvania compared to Texas’s go-get ’em. From time to
                    time, Jim sent care packages to me. They included ground
                    chili from the peppers he dried out at his house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jim was a unique and wonderful man. I will long miss him. I
                    will always be grateful for his friendship and for having
                    the confidence in me to be part of the team that covered the
                    crash of Delta flight 191.

                  <p>
                    Jim and I met in the fall of 1963. We were sophomores being
                    inducted into the Kappa Alpha Order at Drury College in
                    Springfield. We soon became running mates who shared many,
                    many beers, hard nights of play, hard days of study, and
                    comradery with those who were to become life-long brothers.
                    Play might include cutting doughnuts into asphalt extending
                    from Drury to Billing, Mo. We raced and annoyed most
                    onlookers on our Indian motor bikes. Up the terraced lawns,
                    up the porch steps at the frat House. Yes, it was an Animal
                    House where ceilings would spin before the not so dry
                    heaves. It was a time for keeping one foot on the floor when
                    going to bed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was an occasional double-dated with Jim and Jan during
                    those years. (It was Jan Radski at that time). Watching a
                    sophisticated urban socialite adjust to a hyper rural farm
                    boy was a bit like watching a stage play: “The Taming of the
                    Shrew” comes to mind, though it was never clear who was
                    doing the taming. The pair were certainly the most beloved
                    and handsome couple on campus. Jan is still our KA Rose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One a day near graduation I accompanied Jim on his first job
                    interview. It was a small newspaper in the middle of Kansas.
                    Not an easy trip, as we were welcomed into Kansas by a black
                    wall of prairie storm fury. We tossed a coin to decide
                    whether to proceed. We did. While Jim was cloistered in the
                    office of the Owner/ Editor , I sat in the waiting room
                    reading examples of the paper’s award-winning editorials.
                    The articles were of literary quality: insightful,
                    beautifully worded, simple, and almost spiritual in nature.
                    I envisioned those stories and this hometown environment
                    fitting the intellectual side of the Jim I had come to know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the way home we discussed the merits of the interview. I
                    asked him if he would accept the position. Jim said, “No. I
                    don’t know where I’m going. I still have an interview with
                    UPI. But I do know this: I want to know the World. I want to
                    see, experience, and write about those events that are
                    changing that world.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a late-night texting session not so long ago, Jim shared
                    accomplishments of which he was most proud. (Besides being
                    amazed about how many words one text message could contain),
                    I realized, Jim had become that man of world events he
                    envisioned.Now, having read the tributes of those who stood
                    with him during those years of struggle, perhaps his
                    greatest contribution has been nurturing loyal, talented
                    ,and capable allies for another generation of great media
                    innovation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jim was my brother. Though separated by time and distance,
                    we continued to share common aspirations and grieve common
                    losses. My wife and I will sorely miss our Sonoma to
                    Republic get -together-dinners with Jim. They enriched our
                    lives.”

                    Jim was a “glue guy,” that person on a team who naturally
                    brought everyone together and inspired them. It was never
                    flashy, but it was sincere and effective. I never worked for
                    him, but I worked beside him for four years at UPI in Dallas
                    when I moved from news side to sales in 1980. It was a
                    dedicated team. I left in 1984 when it became clear that the
                    unfortunate ownership change was a failure. Jim slogged on
                    for six more years. The testimonies from those who worked
                    for him tell all. He kept an incredible team together under
                    impossible circumstances. Few could do that, and especially
                    not with a smile. He was THE source for knowledge on the
                    whereabouts of former Unipressers. We had a shared interest
                    in auto racing and attended Indy Car and NASCAR races
                    together. I bought his Formula 1 tickets in 2005; the year
                    the series had its tire fiasco at Indianapolis. Only six
                    cars started the race because of tire safety issues. He
                    offered me my money back, but I refused as my party had fun.
                    (I might have needled him about it occasionally, but he took
                    it good-naturedly, true to his demeanor.) I am glad I knew
                    him, and I will miss his presence at UPI gatherings. I am
                    sorry I will miss the celebration in his honor as we will be
                    traveling overseas. RIP.

                    Jim and I met more than 50 years ago when he managed the UPI
                    St. Louis Bureau. I had transferred there as a UPI regional
                    executive on the business side. His journalism creds and
                    people skills were obvious. So in 1972, when I became UPI’s
                    Northeast Division Manager in Boston, I convinced UPI Editor
                    Steve (H. L.) Stevenson to fill the bureau manager’s opening
                    in Boston with Jim. Our friendship flourished, including fun
                    family gatherings, with his kids and mine. Jim later
                    transferred to the Dallas Bureau and I to New York
                    headquarters. We stayed in touch over the years as Jim
                    successfully built out his photo-sharing business in Dallas.
                    I returned to the Boston area to become a newspaper editor.
                    Jim was always a joy to be around — top-notch gentleman,
                    journalist and friend.

                    I met Jim at Drury College in Springfield, Mo. We worked
                    together on the college newspaper, the Drury Mirror, and
                    served consecutive stints as editor. We reunited at United
                    Press International where our paths crossed in the Kansas
                    City and Dallas bureaus. He was a deadline-every-minute
                    reporter in the finest tradition. He wanted to be first with
                    a story, but more importantly, get it right. He saw the
                    digital age coming long before few of us knew what it
                    promised. His timing for founding his company was genius.
                    With our mutual friends and colleagues Travis Hughes and
                    Marge Boatright, he launched Wieck Media with blue chip
                    clients that gave him a huge competitive advantage in
                    harnessing the emerging digital technology. Whenever and
                    wherever he visited through the years, his first stop was
                    the nearest independent bookstore. His voracious appetite
                    for reading came through as the careful and eloquent writer
                    and editor he was. His gift of storytelling extended beyond
                    news to writing and recording music. He even learned to play
                    banjo! If there was a folk music artist performing nearby,
                    he was there. I cherish my years with Jim and miss him
                    greatly.

                  <p>
                    I have so many memories of Jim and that first core group at
                    Wieck with Travis, Marge and Tim. But my favorite story
                    about Jim is from 2 decades later: In 2021 a couple came to
                    buy some shoes at REI in NJ, where I work. We got to
                    talking. They were in town and had been for a few months,
                    cleaning out a family home as her dad passed pretty
                    recently. I learned that they both currently worked in news
                    in Texas and that her dad had been a photographer…well,
                    that’s all she really needed to say, right? So one thing led
                    to another and she told me how she moved from NJ to Texas to
                    work for the Morning-News. I asked her if she ever worked
                    for Molly Ivins. She proceeded to tell me a few pretty funny
                    stories about her arrival at the paper…gotta love those.
                    Then I just went for it, “You don’t by any chance know Jim
                    Wieck or Tim Roberts, do you?” Well, they jumped out of
                    their pants regaling me with stories from pre-social media
                    days. Crazy how small the world can be. The following day,
                    they came in again to show me this photo of Jim dancing with
                    one of their grandmothers at their wedding. It took me a
                    second to recognize the face but I knew the boots
                    immediately!
                  </p>
                  <p>He was one of the good ones.</p>

                  <p>
                    Jim was my first boss in the news biz (a 50 year career I
                    recently concluded) out of college. He wasn’t much older
                    than I but he knew so much more than those few years would
                    suggest. He was bold, funny and never afraid to acknowledge
                    if he made a mistake. He also wasn’t afraid to blaze new
                    trails. He knew I was desperate to cover politics, not just
                    stories in Chinatown. In 1975, there were no Asian reporters
                    at the Massachusetts Statehouse and only 2 other women. But
                    with only 2 years of experience of UPI under my belt, he
                    sent me over there to learn from four experienced and
                    generous of heart colleagues. So my 5 decade career covering
                    presidential, gubernatorial, congressional, Statehouse and
                    mayoral politics is due to Jim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My only complaint of Jim is that he set my expectations of
                    news managers much too high, leading me to believe they
                    would be similar to him. Rude awakening when I realized he
                    was one of kind. Thank you Jim Wieck.

                    Jim and I got to know each other a bit when I lived in Santa
                    Fe for 16 years and he would make it a pit stop on the way
                    from Texas to California and again on the way back. We
                    shared lunches, he always paying. I always knew his name,
                    but only from the wire. Getting to know him personally, bit
                    by bit during those brief stopovers, was a real treasure. I
                    could see in him during those light conversations someone
                    who could be a real friend, someone who cared about what I
                    was thinking and saying. And I cared about what he was
                    saying.

                  <p>
                    One thing we did share was having worked in the Boston buro,
                    my UPI starting gate in the late ‘60s before I moved on to
                    other adventures with this great wire service. Of course,
                    that was long before he got to Boston. But there were times,
                    talking some UPI shop, when I wished he had been my buro
                    manager. That really would have been something. I’m so sorry
                    he’s gone from us.

                  Like a lot of UPI friendships, it started on the internal
                  message wire, which was where some of the best of the wire
                  service’s work was done. I finally met him in person at an
                  Indy 500 in 1986. He approached our restaurant table and he
                  looked like a character out of a Larry McMurtry novel. Once he
                  sat down and started talking, though, he was far more
                  interesting.

                  away. His sense of right and wrong was as black and white as
                  the stories he put on paper, and was never afraid to report it
                  as it was. A great and accomplished man, a kind boss, and
