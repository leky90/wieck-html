                We exist to help the world’s best news organizations and public
                relations, marketing and communications teams share and monitor
                their stories. We don’t mean to toot our own horn, but we’re
                kind of like a backseat driver people actually like. Pushing
                pedal to metal, we’re racing against industry standards to see
                how far we can take our clients. Maybe it’s why The New York
                Times News Service, our very first client, has remained with us
                since May of 1991, when we dramatically sped up their photo
                distribution process.

                  As an award-winning photographer with United Press
                  International and Agence France-Presse, Tim Roberts spent a
                  decade capturing both triumphs and tragedies on film — from
                  Super Bowls, the Final Four, and the Olympics to natural
                  disasters, hostage situations, and the final days of the
                  Branch Davidian standoff. This firsthand experience as a
                  photojournalist proved invaluable when Roberts joined Wieck in
                  early 1991 to help launch operations for what was then known
                  as Wieck Photo DataBase — with The New York Times as its first
                  client.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As photo editor for the enterprise, Roberts soon began looking
                  into the new digital technology and formats available for
                  compressing, storing, and transmitting photographs. Within six
                  months of the startup, Roberts experimented with a system of
                  delivery that enabled newspapers and magazines to dial in via
                  modems and download photo files in less than one-third the
                  time required by previous technologies. By the mid-1990s,
                  Roberts was leading the fast-growing company’s migration to
                  Web services.

                  As an award-winning photographer with United Press

                  As an award-winning photographer with United Press

                  As an award-winning photographer with United Press
                  International and Agence France-Presse, Tim Roberts spent a
                  decade capturing both triumphs and tragedies on film — from
                  Super Bowls, the Final Four, and the Olympics to natural
                  disasters, hostage situations, and the final days of the
                  Branch Davidian standoff. This firsthand experience as a
                  photojournalist proved invaluable when Roberts joined Wieck in
                  early 1991 to help launch operations for what was then known
                  as Wieck Photo DataBase — with The New York Times as its first
                  client.
